# ForgeGradle 1.2

Minecraft mod development framework used by Forge and FML for the gradle build system.

**This is a fork of the [official ForgeGradle](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/ForgeGradle), created to be used by [my fork of Minecraft Forge for 1.7.10](https://github.com/Doenerstyle/MinecraftForge-1.7.10).**

**For mod development, I recommend using [anatawa12's fork](https://github.com/anatawa12/ForgeGradle-1.2) instead.**

## Improvements of this fork

* Fixed the `response 403` error when downloading client, server, or assets. (using resources provided by **@juanmuscaria**).

## Development/Support/Maintenance
This fork of ForgeGradle will only receive updates when necessary/beneficial for my above mentioned fork of Minecraft Forge.
If you want to contribute anything unrelated to that fork, I recommend contributing to [anatawa12's fork](https://github.com/anatawa12/ForgeGradle-1.2) instead.

Regardless of that, **you're very welcome to open issues and PRs as long as they correlate to [my fork of Minecraft Forge for 1.7.10](https://github.com/Doenerstyle/MinecraftForge-1.7.10)**.
